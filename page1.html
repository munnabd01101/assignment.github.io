			<p style="color:black"><font size="4"> I come from a small town called *******. First of all, it’s is very green and has many beaches and mountains.  My hometown has a very small population and the people are very friendly. It also has a small city center or down town area and you can find many shops and restaurants. For example, sea food restaurants supermarkets. Further more,  My hometown is a coastal town as a results, there are many boats and ships called dhows made by a small traditional  wooden ship factory.

			<p1 style="color: black"><font size="4">The good thing about interviews is that a skilled recruiter will typically give hints as to the answers they want from an interviewee. This is particularly true if “discuss your educational background” is one of the interview questions your encounter. The inquiry may also come in the form of “what degrees do you hold?” or “what did you study in school?” Your interviewer is seeking to learn more about how your educational experiences have influenced you and built your skills.

			The best way to answer is to emphasize this more than the logistics of your education. Perhaps you only attended high school and have no college experience. Rather than revealing this- you can discuss what skills you developed in high school and how you might apply them to the job. The objective in responding is not to give a list of the schools you attended but to show that your schooling has had a part in preparing you for the position at hand. If you can relate it to the job skills needed- you can nail the question no matter what level of education you might possess.</font></p1><font size="4"><br> <img src="./MARUF_MUNNA1_files/history-2.jpg" width="500" height="300"><br>
